So here is the ins and outs of me "Aria Rose". So i come up with the name as i really am in love with the name aria and rose just seemed to fit in with the name really well. Then i was wondering how i could implemt that into my life. Then gaming came into my life, so i use the name "Aria Rose" as my gamer tag. No i would never say i am a professinal gamer not by a long shot, but i know how to handle myself in game. The fact you can just emerse yourself in a game always fasinated me, the fact there are many diffrent genres no matter what mood your in there is a game for it.
